# CSS Button Maker (cbm) contributing guidelines

**Note:**

Contributions cannot just be a simple refactor of code or anything similar.

Contributions must help improve the overall functionality of the code. These can include making themes, plugins, changing the overall app, making modules, etc.

Make sure your design matches the design of the app or looks good in the app.
